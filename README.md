# Chocolate Sales Data Analysis 🍫📊

This repository contains an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on chocolate sales data. The analysis aims to uncover sales patterns, product performance, regional trends, and actionable business insights using Python's data science tools.

---

## 📅 Project Objective
To analyze chocolate sales data by cleaning, visualizing, and interpreting key metrics like sales amount, boxes shipped, and sales performance across different countries, products, and salespersons.

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scipy.stats** – outlier detection (Z-score method)  
- **Datetime** – date formatting and time-based analysis

---

## 👀 Key Features
- Cleaned the `Amount` column (removal of $ and commas, converted to float)
- Converted `Date` to datetime format for monthly/yearly analysis
- Removed outliers using Z-score method for `Amount` and `Boxes Shipped`
- Visualized:
  - Total sales per country
  - Product-wise performance
  - Salesperson-wise distribution
  - Box shipment trends

---

## 🔎 Insights Explored
- Top-performing countries and products
- Sales distribution and volume trends
- Time-based behavior (if date granularity allows)
- Outlier impact on sales reporting
